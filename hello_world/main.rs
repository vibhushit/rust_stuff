fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world");
}

// println! is a macro as we are use ! after the name and we passed "Hello, world" as the argument
// ot the macro. So println! is not a function it is different from a function and we use "!" to
// denote that.
// main() fn is the entry point to the rust program.
